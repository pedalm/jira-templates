# JIRA Templates

Below you can find a set of templates I use by default when creating a new ticket in JIRA, depending on the ticket type.

### Story

```
## Background
_Add a relevant description to what we're doing and, especially, **why** we're doing it in a business-oriented language._

## Acceptance Criteria & Scenarios
+Scenario: Feature behavior title+
**Given** _define-initial-state_
**When** _describe-action_
**Then** _assert-desired-result_

* Criteria point A
* Criteria point B
* ...

## Notes
_Add any additional information that might be of relevance to this ticket here_
```

### Bug
```
## Description
_Add relevant description to what is not working properly or as expected_

## Steps to reproduce
* _Go here_

```
